# Contributing to Golden Armor Studios

Thanks for helping us forge new worlds! This guide explains how to contribute code, design, docs, or feedback across Golden Armor Studios repositories.

## Getting Started
1. **Explore Projects** – Review the README and wiki for the repo you’re targeting.
2. **Check Issues & Projects** – Look for `help wanted`, `good first issue`, or `enhancement` tags; consult the organization project boards for priorities.
3. **Discuss First** – For large changes, open a Discussion or comment on an issue to align on scope and approach.

## Development Workflow
1. **Fork / Branch** – Create a feature branch (`yourname/feature-name`) from the latest `main`.
2. **Set Up Environment** – Follow repo-specific setup guides (Firebase configs, Swift toolchains, Node versions, etc.).
3. **Build & Test** – Run unit tests, linters, and platform-specific checks. Include screenshots or simulator recordings for UI changes when practical.
4. **Document** – Update README, wiki, or in-code documentation as needed.
5. **Commit** – Write clear, scoped commit messages. Keep logical changes together.
6. **Pull Request** – Submit a PR with:
   - Summary of changes
   - Linked issues (e.g., `Closes #123`)
   - Testing evidence (commands run, results)
   - Screenshots or logs when relevant
7. **Review Cycle** – Address feedback promptly, keep discussions respectful, and note follow-up tasks if deferments are required.

## Style & Standards
- Follow project-specific linting/formatting rules (SwiftLint, ESLint, Prettier, etc.).
- Prefer descriptive names, small functions, and clear separation of concerns.
- Ensure CI workflows pass before requesting review.
