# Golden Armor Studios Code of Conduct

We’re building ambitious experiences together—respect and collaboration keep that momentum strong. By participating in Golden Armor Studios communities (issues, discussions, PRs, Discord, or events), you agree to the following:

## Core Expectations
- **Be welcoming.** Encourage new contributors, document decisions, and share context generously.
- **Assume good intent.** Ask clarifying questions before drawing conclusions and respond with patience.
- **Keep it professional.** Focus conversations on the work, not the person. Debate ideas, not individuals.
- **Support teamwork.** Offer constructive feedback, follow through on commitments, and hand off work clearly.
- **Protect privacy.** Don’t share private project data, unreleased features, or personal information without permission.

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment, bullying, or threats of any kind.
- Personal attacks, insults, or attempts to derail constructive discussion.
- Sharing malicious content, including exploits or intentionally harmful code.
- Unsolicited promotion, spam, or attempts to disrupt collaboration spaces.

## Reporting & Enforcement
If you witness or experience behavior that violates this code:
- Reach out privately to the core maintainers at [hello@goldenarmorstudio.com](mailto:hello@goldenarmorstudio.com).
- Alternatively, contact an owner via GitHub DM or Discord.

Reports are handled confidentially. Maintainers may take any action deemed appropriate, including warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal from community spaces.

## Scope
This code applies to all Golden Armor Studios repositories, communication channels, community events, and any public representation of the project.

Let’s keep the community a creative, supportive place where everyone can forge something remarkable.
